## Why Pelican? ##
I choose Pelican because I was looking for a static web framework with support for displaying Jupyter notebooks inline with Markdown documents.

## Ingredients
* A derivative of the middle-theme
* Tipue search
* Liquid-tags.notebook to display Jupyter notebooks
* Tag-cloud
* Custom display of pages in navbar
* Social icons for Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, Flickr, Github, Bitbucket, Blocks and Spotify
