## Why Pelican? 
I choose Pelican because I was looking for a static web framework with support for displaying Jupyter notebooks inline with Markdown documents.

## Ingredients
* A derivative of the middle-theme
* Tipue search
* Liquid-tags.notebook to display Jupyter notebooks
* Tag-cloud
* Custom display of pages in navbar
* Social icons for Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, Flickr, Github, Bitbucket, Blocks and Spotify

## Remember
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Pelican and other dependencies
* `npm install less` after installing node for the `less` compiler
* `git clone https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipynb` to plugin folder
