Summary: Inspired by this [tutorial](https://qbox.io/blog/building-an-elasticsearch-index-with-python) I tried to continue investigating [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) since I would like to use a fast indexing tool for the data I am gathering and the applications I am developing.
