Summary: In my previous [post](http://pelican.jitsejan.com/unittesting-in-jupyter-notebook.html) on testing in Python I explained how to test in a Jupyter Notebook. Now a few weeks later I need to get familiar with mocking in Python. Since this is a new concept for me I made a small notebook testing different functionalities of the mocking library.
