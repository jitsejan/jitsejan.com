    "This notebook makes use of the [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org) library to scrape data from a website. Following the basic example, we create a QuotesSpider and call the CrawlerProcess with this spider to retrieve quotes from http://quotes.toscrape.com. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook two pipelines are defined, both writing results to a JSON file. The first option is to create a separate class that defines the pipeline and explicitly has the functions to write to a file per found item. It enables more flexibility when dealing with stranger data formats, or if you want to setup a custom way of writing items to file. The pipeline is set in the custom_settings parameter ITEM_PIPELINES inside the QuoteSpider class. However, I simply want to write the list of items that are found in the spider to a JSON file and therefor it is easier to choose the second option, where only the FEED_FORMAT has to be set to JSON and the output file needs to be defined in FEED_URI inside the custom settings of the spider. No additional classes or definitions need to be created, making the FEED_FORMAT/FEED_URI a convenient option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the quotes are retrieved the JSON file will be created on disk and can be loaded to a Pandas dataframe. This dataframe can then be analyzed, modified and be used for further processing. This notebook simply loads the JSON file to a dataframe and writes it again to a pickle. "
