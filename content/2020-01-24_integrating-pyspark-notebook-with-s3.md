Summary: In my post [Using Spark to read from S3](https://www.jitsejan.com/using-spark-to-read-from-s3.html) I explained how I was able to connect Spark to AWS S3 on a Ubuntu machine. Last week I was trying to connect to S3 again using Spark on my local machine, but I wasn't able to read data from our datalake. Our datalake is hosted in the  `eu-west-2` region which apparently requires you to specify the version of authentication. Instead of setting up the right environment on my machine and reconfigure everything, I chose to update the Docker image from my [notebook repo](https://github.com/jitsejan/notebooks) so I could test on my Mac before pushing it to my server. Instead of configuring both my local and remote environment I can simply spin up the Docker container and have two identical environments. 

## Introduction

In my post [Using Spark to read from S3](https://www.jitsejan.com/using-spark-to-read-from-s3.html) I explained how I was able to connect Spark to AWS S3 on a Ubuntu machine. Last week I was trying to connect to S3 again using Spark on my local machine, but I wasn't able to read data from our datalake. Our datalake is hosted in the  `eu-west-2` region which apparently requires you to specify the version of authentication. Instead of setting up the right environment on my machine and reconfigure everything, I chose to update the Docker image from my [notebook repo](https://github.com/jitsejan/notebooks) so I could test on my Mac before pushing it to my server. Instead of configuring both my local and remote environment I can simply spin up the Docker container and have two identical environments. 

## Implementation

Rather than providing the AWS credentials in the Spark config, I want to keep things simple and only have one credential file from where I will read the important information. The contents of `~/.aws/credentials ` specify just one account in this example, but this is where I have specified all the different AWS accounts we are using. This file will be copied to the Docker container by mounting the local `aws` folder inside the Docker instance.

```ini
[prod]
aws_access_key_id = xxxxxxyyyyyyy
aws_secret_access_key = zzzzzzzzyyyyyyy
region = eu-west-2 
```

The Dockerfile consists of different steps. I have stripped down the Dockerfile to only install the essentials to get Spark working with S3 and a few extra libraries (like `nltk`) to play with some data. A few things to note:

- The base image is the `pyspark-notebook` provided by [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/pyspark-notebook).
- Some packages are installed to be able to install the rest of the Python requirements.
- The Jupyter configuration (see below) is copied to the Docker image.
- Two libraries for Spark are downloaded to interact with AWS. These particular versions seem to work well, where newer versions caused different issues during my testing.
- The Python packages are installed defined in the `requirements.txt`.
- The Jupyter packages and extensions are installed and enabled.
- The notebook is started in Jupyter *lab* mode.

```dockerfile
FROM jupyter/pyspark-notebook
USER root
# Add essential packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential curl git gnupg2 nano apt-transport-https software-properties-common
# Set locale
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y locales \
    && echo "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" > /etc/locale.gen \
    && locale-gen
# Add config to Jupyter notebook
COPY jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py /home/jovyan/.jupyter/
RUN chmod -R 777 /home/jovyan/
# Spark libraries
RUN wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/amazonaws/aws-java-sdk/1.7.4/aws-java-sdk-1.7.4.jar -P $SPARK_HOME/jars/
RUN wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-aws/2.7.3/hadoop-aws-2.7.3.jar -P $SPARK_HOME/jars/

USER $NB_USER
# Install Python requirements
COPY requirements.txt /home/jovyan/
RUN pip install -r /home/jovyan/requirements.txt
# Install NLTK
RUN python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('popular')"
# Custom styling
RUN mkdir -p /home/jovyan/.jupyter/custom
COPY custom/custom.css /home/jovyan/.jupyter/custom/
# NB extensions
RUN jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
RUN jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable --user
# Run the notebook
CMD ["/opt/conda/bin/jupyter", "lab", "--allow-root"]
```

The Jupyter configuration file sets up the notebook environment. In my case I set the password, the startup directory and the IP restrictions.

```python
""" jupyter_notebook_config.py """
c = get_config()
c.InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity = "all"
c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*' 
c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'
c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = '/opt/notebooks/'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:a123:345345'
c.NotebookApp.port = 8558
```

The `docker-compose.yml` contains the setup of the Docker instance. The most important parts of the compose file are:

- The notebook and data folder are mapped from the Docker instance to a local folder.
- The credential file is mapped from the Docker machine to the local machine.
- The public port is set to 8558.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  jitsejan-pyspark:
    user: root
    privileged: true
    image: jitsejan/pyspark-notebook
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./notebooks:/opt/notebooks
      - ./data:/opt/data
      - $HOME/.aws/credentials:/home/jovyan/.aws/credentials:ro
    environment:
      - GRANT_SUDO=yes
    ports:
      - "8558:8558"

```

## Execution

I am running Docker version 19.03.5 at the time of writing.

```bash

```

Run `docker-compose up` after creating the compose file to spin up the notebook. 

```bash
~/code/notebooks > master $ docker-compose up

```

The container is now running on port `8558`:

```bash
~/code/notebooks > master $ docker ps

For convenience I am running [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) because it is easier to get an overview of the containers running in Docker instead of using the CLI.. It also helps to clean up all the orphan images.

## Code

To connect Spark to S3 I will use the `credentials` file as configuration file and use the `configparser` library to read the parameters.

```python
from configparser import ConfigParser

config_object = ConfigParser()
config_object.read("/home/jovyan/.aws/credentials")
profile_info = config_object["prod"]
```

Since the configuration now contains the production account data I can use it so set the parameters for the Spark context. Note that all these parameters are required to connect to the data on S3. The access key and secret are always mentioned in tutorials, but it took me a while to figure out I need to specify the `endpoint` and enable V4. 

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf, SQLContext

conf = (
    SparkConf()
    .set("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access", True)
    .set("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key", profile_info.get('aws_access_key_id'))
    .set("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key", profile_info.get('aws_secret_access_key'))
    .set("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint", f"s3-{profile_info.get('region')}.amazonaws.com")
    .set("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem")
    .set("com.amazonaws.services.s3.enableV4", True)
    .set("spark.driver.extraJavaOptions", "-Dcom.amazonaws.services.s3.enableV4=true")
)
```

WIth the above configuration I initialize the Spark context and can read from our datalake. 

```python
sc = SparkContext(conf=conf).getOrCreate()
sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)
df = sqlContext.read.parquet("s3a://mi-datalake-prod/warehouse/platform/company_list/")
```
